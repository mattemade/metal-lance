# Metal Lance

Game made for [1-bit jam #3](https://itch.io/jam/1-bit-jam-three/rate/2633292).

[Music tracks](assets/music) and [sounds effects](assets/sound) are made by nicole starlight:

* https://nicolestarlight.itch.io/
* https://soundcloud.com/nicolestarlight

Planned to be a mixture of beat 'em up and bullet hell scroll shooter. Ended up just as a scroll shooter, but it is
fine.

Jam theme is "transformation", and I am going to interpret it without any creativity in mind: the main character can
transform (kinda, a bit).

## Behind the schedule

* Level 3 + boss

## Nice-to-have, but won't do
* transitions between menu screens
* menu sounds and selection effects
* touch controls (for playing from phones)
* level environments (lightning strikes, background/foreground objects, etc.)

useful stuff.

# metal-lance

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a Kotlin project template that includes Kotlin application launchers
and [KTX](https://libktx.github.io/) utilities.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3.
- `teavm`: Experimental web platform using TeaVM and WebGL.

## Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/lib`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `teavm:build`: builds the JavaScript application into the build/dist/webapp folder.
- `teavm:run`: serves the JavaScript application at http://localhost:8080 via a local Jetty server.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should
be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
